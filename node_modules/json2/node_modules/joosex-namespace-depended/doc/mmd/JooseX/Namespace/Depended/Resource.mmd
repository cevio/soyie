JooseX.Namespace.Depended.Resource - Abstract resource class 


SYNOPSIS
========
        
        //mostly for subclassing only
        Class("JooseX.Namespace.Depended.Resource.JavaScript", {
        
            isa : JooseX.Namespace.Depended.Resource,
            
            ...
        })


DESCRIPTION
===========

`JooseX.Namespace.Depended.Resource` is an abstract resource class. Its not supposed to be used directly, instead you should use
one of its subclasses.


ATTRIBUTES
==========

### attachedTo

> `Object attachedTo`

> An arbitrary object to which this resource is attached (its a corresponding class in JooseX.Namespace.Depended)


### type

> `String type`

> A type of resource  - plain string. `JooseX.Namespace.Depended.Manager` maintain a collection of resource types, accessible 


### token

> `String token`

> A token of resource  - plain string with arbitrary semantic. Each subclass should provide this semantic along with `token -> url` conertion method (locator)  


### id

> `String id`

> An id of resource - is computed as `type + '://' + token'


### loading

> `Boolean loading`

> A sign whether this resource is currently loading

  
### loaded

> `Boolean loaded`

> A sign whether this resource is already loaded


### ready

> `Boolean ready`

> A sign whether this resource is considered ready. Resource is ready, when its loaded, and all its dependencies are ready.


### loadedFromURL

> `String loadedFromURL`

> An url, from which the resource was loaded.


### readyListeners

> `Array[Function] readyListeners`

> An array of functions, which will be called after this resource becomes ready. Functions will be called sequentially. 


### dependencies

> `Object dependencies`

> An object containing the dependencies of this resource. Keys are the `id`s of resources and the values - the resource instances itself.

 
### onBeforeReady

> `Function onBeforeReady`

> A function, which will be called, right after the all dependencies of the resource became ready, but before its own `readyListeners` will be called.
It supposed to perform any needed additional actions to post-process the loaded resource.

> Function will receive two arguments - the 1st is the callback, which should be called when `onBeforeReady` will finish its work. 2nd is the resource instance.

  
### version

> `r/w Number version`

> A version of this resource. Currently is handled as Number, this may change in future releases.

  
### requiredVersion

> `r/w Number requiredVersion`

> A *requiredVersion* version of this resource. Required here means the maximum version from all references to this resource. 



METHODS
=======

### addDescriptor

> `void addDescriptor(Object|String descriptor)`

> Add the resource, described with passed descriptor as the dependency for this resource.


### getUrls

> `String|Array[String] getUrls()`

> Abstract method, will throw an exception if not overriden. It should return the array of urls (or a single url) from which this resource can be potentially loaded. 
This method should take into account the `use.paths` setting


### load

> `void load(String url, Function onsuccess, Function onerror)`

> Abstract method, will throw an exception if not overriden. It should load the content of the resource from the passed `url`. If there was an error during loading
(for example file not found) should not throw the exception. Instead, should call the `onerror` continuation with it (exception instance).

> After successfull loading, should call the `onsuccess` continuation with the resource content as 1st argument, and `url` as 2nd: `onsuccess(text, url)`


### materialize

> `void materialize(String resourceBlob, String url)`

> Abstract method, will throw an exception if not overriden. It should "materialize" the resource. The concrete semantic of this action is determined by resource nature.
For example this method can create some tag in the DOM tree, or execute the code or something else.

> Currently this method is supposed to operate synchronously, this may change in future releases.
